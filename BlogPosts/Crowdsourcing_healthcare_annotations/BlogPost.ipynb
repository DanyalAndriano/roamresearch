    "__TL;DR__ For most annotation tasks in healthcare, we must rely on trained experts, who are always in high-demand, creating a bottleneck for system development. Can we address this limitation by crowdsourcing the easier annotation tasks in this space? We report on an experiment addressing this question, with a focus on how to identify problematic workers and infer reliable annotations from noisy crowd work."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining high-quality annotations is a bottleneck for all natural language processing applications. The challenges are especially severe in healthcare, where we rely on annotators who have expertise in the practice of medicine and in understanding medical texts, and who are authorized to access sensitive data. Such annotators are in high-demand and thus demand high prices. The question then arises whether we can ease the burden on these annotators by crowdsourcing the less demanding annotation tasks involving publicly-available data, reserving the experts for where they are truly needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post reports on a crowdsourcing experiment we ran to explore this issue. We defined a reasonably nuanced span-identification task, and launched it on [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com). As expected, the output was noisy, as a result of the highly variable pool of annotators we tapped into. To infer quality labels from this noisy process, we used a straightforward application of Expectation-Maximization, with quite good results, suggesting that crowdsourcing is an effective tool for obtaining annotations for at least some NLP problems in healthcare."

We could define consensus in various ways – e.g., the majority label, or at least 70% agreement on a label (leaving some cases without a label at all). However, these approaches are clearly suboptimal because they make the implicit assumption that all workers are equally trustworthy, by giving equal weight to all of them. To address this, we use a simple application of the [Expectation-Maximization (EM) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation–maximization_algorithm) to our matrix of worker judgments.\n",

We see however that there is a high correlation between workers' behavior; they tend to miss the same text segments. In our task, this has a likely explanation: to maximize profit, workers might choose to increase their judgment rate at the cost of reducing work quality. By reading sentences superficially, they would identify the most obvious relevant mentions while missing more demanding ones. This strategy could go unnoticed during judgment collection because our gold-label assessment deliberately avoids difficult cases and ambiguity.\n",

    "Although, these findings also reveal that a large group of workers with similar biases might lead to misleading results with EM. For example, a large group of consistently wrong workers would appear to be reliable and might even drown out the work of a smaller, more reliable group. Any unsupervised method will have weaknesses like this, which highlights the importance of having at least some expert annotators reviewing the work."
